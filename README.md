# Code-Challenge

This is a method for users to run interactive meetings with investors in to describe their product and gauge interest in investment. There is two components, one is the actual chat application, and the other component is an agenda application that can be edited in real-time where the users and investors go over the agenda for the day. The agenda file contains the code for the agenda/task component of the project and the public, utils, and server files contain relevant code for the chat application component. I have recorded YouTube videos going over project with one video screensharing the project and showing it visually, and the other video recording my voice explaining what I am doing. This means that there are two separate videos that must be watched simultaneously. This is the link for the screen shared visual component: https://youtu.be/3Fsonq_5Hqc and this is the link for the audio: https://youtu.be/qdjttB4_ThQ.
